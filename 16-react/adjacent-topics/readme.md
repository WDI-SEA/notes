These are all optional topics that are great to do if you have time in class!

## Topics

### Redux

Redux is a state management tool. It's use isn't exclusive to React, but you will often hear the two paired up in conversation. It's hard to talk about React for very long without Redux getting brought up. It's the most popular state-management tool for React. In large-scale React apps, state management tools become more and more crucial! For smaller-scale apps, it is often a cost-benefit analysis on whether setting up Redux is worth the amount of overhead involved.

### React Native

React native is a framework that allows you to make mobile apps! It can port to either Andriod or iOS. 

### TypeScript

TypeScript is JavaScript... with strict types! This is useful because it makes your code more predictable and your error messages will be more helpful. It also prevents the odd error that slips by a `==` versus a `===`.

### Context API

If you find yourself "prop drilling" through multiple levels, but your app doesn't feel quite big enough for Redux to pay dividends, using Context may be for you. You can still use prop drilling alongside it if needed, but it provides a less complex solution than Redux that still helps simplify your app.
