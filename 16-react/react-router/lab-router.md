## Recap

What have we learned so far?

* Single Page Applications have specific URLs that are routed to display

  different content.

* React Router is a third-party library that we can install and use with React.
* Since React Router isn't built in to React, we must import its components.
* React Router makes it easy for us to route URLs to components.
* React Router automatically manipulates modern browser history mechanics.

Now let's put that to the test!

## You Do: Implement Router

Let's create the scaffolding for a restaurant website called `restaurant_router`.

Your site needs to have five pages:

* Home (landing page)
* Menu 
* About
* Contact

Task:

* Each page is a component - we're learning to use React Router here!
* Create a navigation menu of list items that Route to each page.
  * These pages don't need to have much content â€” just the header at the top saying what the page is and a paragraph description of your choosing.

_Fun Note:_ There's no reason you can't change the CSS, if you'd like! The CSS file that you'll change is `App.css`. If you'd like, you can grab ours [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/education-product/React-Exercise-Solutions/blob/master/projects/project-04-router/solution-code/src/App.css).

* Thought exercise: Why is that the only CSS file you need to change?

**Hint**: Do you have `react-router-dom` installed for this project?

<!-- **Hint**: You can instantiate a component with `props` inside of a `<Route>` element. An example is below:

<!-- ## Solution

Your solution should look something like as follows:
