AngularJS is an example of a MVC framework, where everything displayed is dependent on data manipulated in a controller. A few years ago at Facebook, the Facebook development team created a framework designed only for the *View*. This resulted in ReactJS, a framework for creating user interfaces (the view).

Currently, React is in high demand and often used in tandem with modern/experimental tools such as Webpack, Gulp, and ES6.
