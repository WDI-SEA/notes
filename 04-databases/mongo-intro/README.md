# MongoDB

## Objectives

* Describe how Mongo databases came about & why they're useful
* Compare and contrast NoSQL with SQL
* Define what a document is in the context of MongoDB
* Explain the difference between embedded and referenced documents, and how we use each to model relationships in MongoDB
* Issue basic CRUD commands to a database from the Mongo Shell

### Administration Interface

In PostgreSQL, we used an administration interface \(PG Commander\) to easily interact with our database.

For OSX users, we recommend [MongoHub](https://github.com/jeromelebel/MongoHub-Mac)

For Linux users, we recommend the free edition of [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/) \(formerly called Robomongo!\)
