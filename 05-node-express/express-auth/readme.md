# Express Authentication

Most web applications will require login/logout functionality. Over the next day or two, we will build a node/express that is set up to handle users in this way. You will then be able to use this bare bones app as a boilerplate for your Unit 2 project.

You already know how to do a lot of this stuff, but the auth-specific parts will be new, and there are several of them. It's totally ok for those parts to feel unclear. You will not be asked to recreate this ever in this class. Most apps in the wild deal with users, so it's important to have exposure and a bit of experience on how this important functionality can by incorporated into an app. That is the point of doing this code-along.

Buckle up!
