#Intro to Git

## Objectives

* Define version control systems
* Identify main git commands to manage files
* Distinguish bewteen local and remote repositories

## Motivation

Have you ever worked on a paper or any document collaboratively with others?

* What have you noticed?
* What was the workflow like?
* What did work, what didn't?

Now enter software programming. Programming is a highly team based activity. That's why I love programming: A project is always more fun when you've got friends working with you. Sometimes very large teams work on a single project. We as developers need tools that support collaborative working. Enter **Version Control Systems**.
