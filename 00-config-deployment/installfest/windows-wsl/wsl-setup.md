# WSL Setup

## WSL Install

This is a resource guide for setting up a Windows PC with **WSL**, Windows Subsystem for Linux.

This process involves restarting your computer at least once and downloading large files for a Linux OS Distribution

## Before the first day of class

Before the first day of class, please:

1. Read [Microsoft's WSL introduction page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux/1-introduction):
2. Follow [Microsoft's WSL Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps) to enable WSL and install a Linux distribution \(Ubuntu is recommended\)
   * _**IMPORTANT**_: Be sure to remember the password you use when setting up your first user account in Linux, it is something you will be using often! Choose something easy to type and remember.
3. Do the commands listed in the [Try a few basic Linux commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux/3-integration-between-linux-and-windows) tutorial to start getting comfortable with the WSL shell.
4. Enable the Copy/Paste feature by following the steps in [this guide](https://defragged.org/2020/10/29/how-to-copy-paste-in-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl/)

If you have WSL enabled and Ubuntu installed with a Bash terminal on your machine, you are ready for installfest on the first day of class! üëç
