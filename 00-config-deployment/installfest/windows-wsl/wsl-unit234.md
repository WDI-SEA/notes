# WSL Unit 2, 3, and 4 installfest

**Stop!** The following instructions pertain to units 2-4 - revisit this section in unit 2!

## Unit 2 - PostgresQL

When it comes to installing database technologies - WSL has a handful of extra configuration steps as the installations will not work by default.

* [PostgresQL Webpage](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/)

```bash
# Create the file repository configuration:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'

# Import the repository signing key:
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -

# Update the package lists:
sudo apt-get update

# Install the latest version of PostgreSQL.
# If you want a specific version, use 'postgresql-12' or similar instead of 'postgresql':
sudo apt-get -y install postgresql
```

### WSL-specific configuration instructions

By default on WSL - running the `psql` command will give you an error similar to:

`psql: error: FATAL: role "<your_user_name>" does not exist`

## The fix:

* Run the following commands one by one, but change `<your_user_name>` to your linux username!

```bash
# Auto start the postgres server
sudo -u postgres pg_ctlcluster 13 main start

# Start the postgres server the first time
sudo service postgresql start

# Create a postgres user that matches your username
sudo -u postgres createuser <your_user_name>

# Create a postgres database that matches your username
sudo -u postgres createdb <your_user_name>

# Run psql as the postgres user
sudo -u postgres psql
```

* The last command will bring you inside of the `psql` shell - run the following command

```text
ALTER USER <your_user_name> WITH SUPERUSER;
```

## Unit 3 - MongoDB

When it comes to installing database technologies - WSL has a handful of extra configuration steps as the installations will not work by default.

* Run the following commands one by one:

```bash
sudo apt install mongodb
sudo service mongodb start
```

* Test if it worked by running the `mongo` command. If you are in the mongo shell, then it worked!
* If it didn't work, and you get an error referring to `/data/db` - run the following:

```text
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
sudo chmod 777 /data/db
mongod --dbpath /data/db
```

## Unit 4 - Python

Python install instructions - run the following commands in your terminal

```bash
# install python
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

In your `~/.zshrc` file, add the following lines

```bash
# Alias python to python3
alias python=python3
alias pip=pip3

# To allow pip packages to be in PATH
path+=(/home/<your_user_name>/.local/bin)
```
