# WSL Visual upgrades

## Zsh install, OhMyZsh, and P10k theme + font

`zsh` is an alternative shell program to the default linux shell program `bash`.

A shell is a text based Command Line Interface \(CLI\) with which we can interact with our computer to run programs and commands.

There are a number of advantages to using Zsh, primarily in the customizability and aesthetics department!

### Zsh Install

Open the Ubuntu terminal app In the terminal run the following commands: \(follow the prompts and press y to confirm yes when it prompts you to\)

```text
sudo apt install zsh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Exit the ubuntu terminal and reopen it. It will prompt you with the Z Shell configuration menu - press 2 to populate zsh with the recommended defaults

### Oh my Zsh install

Oh My Zsh is a Zsh configuration framework that gives you way more customization options and a ton of visual themes to choose from .

* [OhMyZsh webpage](https://ohmyz.sh/#install)
* Run the following command in the Ubuntu terminal

  ```text
  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
  ```

### Font Install

We need to install a custom font to enable the use of various icons that our terminal will use. Powerlevel10k recommends the MesloLGS NF font.

* [Powerlevel10k font install instructions](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#manual-font-installation)
* Download and install the following font files
  * \[MesloLGS NF Regular.ttf\]\(

  * \[MesloLGS NF Bold.ttf\]\(

  * \[MesloLGS NF Bold Italic.ttf\]\(

* Right click the Ubuntu terminal header bar, click on 'Properties', click on the 'Font' tab, and change the font fo 'MesloLGS NF', or whichever other font you've installed!

### Powerlevel10k install \(Optional\)

Powerlevel10k is a fantastic theme for OhMyZsh that includes all the bells and whistles and has a very powerful configuration tool that makes it super easy to use

* [Powerlevel10k webpage](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#oh-my-zsh)
* Run the following command in your terminal

  ```text
  git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
  ```

* Edit the `.zshrc` config file with our newly downloaded theme

  ```text
  code ~/.zshrc
  ```

* Find the ZSH\_THEME line and set it to be

  ```text
  ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
  ```

### Windows Terminal \(Optional\)

Windows terminal is an application that gives you more flexibility and customization options with your terminal window than the regular terminal.

Nice features include tabs and color themes

1. Install from the Windows Store
2. Go to Settings -&gt; Profiles -&gt; Ubuntu -&gt; Click on 'Open JSON file' in the bottom left
3. Open the JSON file with VS Code or notepad
4. Under "profiles" -&gt; "list" find the one with `"name": "Ubuntu"`, and add:

   ```text
   "commandline": "wsl.exe ~",
   "fontFace": "MesloLGS NF",
   ```

With this done you can now start using the Windows Terminal instead of the Ubuntu terminal!
