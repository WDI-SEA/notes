# Archived Section

Sometimes we want to refer back to older code or lesson material. Maybe we're working on legacy code or maybe we just feel bad deleting stuff. In any case, this section includes:

## React

Written in 2015 or so. Replaced with newer \(2019\) React material.

## Angular

Angular version 1.5 \(AngularJS\). Discontinued after WDI 13 at the Seattle campus.

## Ruby and Ruby on Rails

Node.js and Python backends are now taught exclusively at SEA SEI

## Mongo

Written 2015 or so. Replaced with mongo version 6 (2023) lessons.

## Windows Installfests

WSL is mainly used in SEI for windows machines, but the old install information can still help students with older machines that cannot run WSL.
