#Express Authentication

Most web applications will require login/logout functionality. In this section, we'll cover how to add authentication to our applications. We'll also cover the different modules necessary for password security, authenticated sessions, flash messages, and authorization.

We'll start off with researching components, which we'll do in groups. Then, we'll try coding the components in groups before going over a brief overview of the different components we'll be using.

Then, we'll combine these components in the afternoon in order to get a working authentication example.
