#Introduction to Node.js and Express

## Objectives
* Interact with a package manager
* Create Express routes that utilize parameters and form middleware
* Contrast and implement different HTTP verbs through Express routes
* Implement and explain the components of a basic Express app

## Review: Client-Server

* What's the front-end?
* What's the back-end?
* Why do we need a back-end?
