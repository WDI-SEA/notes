# Web Development Trends
What's the most popular framework right now? Am I learning the right technologies?
These are questions Web Developers (amateur, novice and professional) ask themselves
many times. Web Development is an ever-changing landscape with lots of moving pieces.

These resources are well-compiled sources of information that will help you understand
what's popular, what's proven, and what's changing in the world of Web Development.

Remember: don't get caught up trying to learn all the latest frameworks! There's
too much to know. Always prioritize expanding your fundamental knowledge of web
development and programming first, then find frameworks that help you do what you want
to do second. Keep an open mind, peruse new libraries and just see what sticks!

Seriously, your own hobby projects, conversations you have with other
developers, tools you're forced to use on the job and your own casual web
browsing will keep you up to date on good tools and lead you to learn more
about the things you need to use!
