# Post-Cohort Resources 🎓

We have spent the last three months working hard and becoming software engineers, and all your hard work has paid off: now its time for the *really fun part!* Using your new skills as a coder, you can now continue to grow as your interests and passions guide your studies and career path.

There are so many areas of specialization and knowledge to study in this field, you can let your interests guide you as embark on your post cohort studies.

## 💫 Succeeding Post-Cohort

> *Success is when preparation meets opportunity* 

Succeeding is a very simple formula: `success = preparation + opportunity`. Preparation and opportunity are both things you very much have under your control. For us as software engineers, this means searching for the right career opportunity and preparing by studying to hone our skills and cultivate our knowledge. 

Establishing good patterns for your post-cohort studies and job search is  _absolutely essential_ for your continued success after graduation. 

*Don't Worry, its a simple formula: `s = p + o`!* 

This document is meant to give a outline of how to succeed post-cohort with the `preparation` part of the equation and provide a ton of great resources for you to utilize. 

_If you have any resources you would like to share with everyone or find to be super helpful in the future, submit a pull request to this repo and they will get merged in!_

## 🙄 TL;DR

Here are some answers for common situations you might find yourself in post-SEI:

<details>
    <summary>I Feel like I need to review the entire course/I would like to dive deeper into Fullstack Web Engineering concepts</summary>

#### Work through [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

If you feel like you could use a solid review of the fundamentals *_OR_* you would like to build on the foundations you made in this course you should work your way through [fullstack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). It is a full course of software engineering that is very well maintained by the University of Helsinki.

Fullstack open covers the basics of every topic we touched on, from a complete introduction to js, webservers, React and databases and more. It covers many topics from a new perspective, which will also be enormously beneficial. 

On top of reviewing the core concepts we have studied, fullstack open moves on to teach *extremely* relevant skills and tools such as testing, toolchaining, advanced react hooks, typescript, graphQL and more.

    <summary>I Want to deep dive in DSA</summary>

#### Do [This online course in python DSA from Freecodecamp/Jovian](https://jovian.com/learn/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python) and Study [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds/index.html) 

* [The online course in python DSA from Freecodecamp/Jovian](https://jovian.com/learn/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python) is great. Its comprehensive, focuses on solving interview style problems, and follows the We do/You do format that we use class, so there are activities to do after lectures to practice. It will reinforce what we studied in class and introduce new concepts along the way.
* [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/pythonds/index.html) is essentially the standard DSA book for python currently. I (Weston) have a hard copy I thumb threw before unit 4 usually to brush up on things. [There is also a set a videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdZHjXfvIEU&list=PLtbC5OfOR8aqA6CJwWTRUITgGpUy1Umr3) to accompany to the book that are nice.

    <summary>I Want to prepare for technical interviews</summary>
 
#### Read [The Technical Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/software-engineering-interview-guide/) and practice interviews with [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/#/)

* [The interview handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/software-engineering-interview-guide/) is a study guide specifically written to help prep for FAANG interviews, but is quite appropriate for all technical interviews
* [Pramp](http://pramp.com/) connects you with other folks to practice technicals

</details>

<details>
    <summary>I want to learn a new technology
</summary>
 
#### Build things with it!

Its always a good idea learn one new thing at a time, to isolate the concepts and avoid watering down the learning process.

* Start by reading the documentation, often times there will hello world examples and links to learning resources
* Build several learning projects from tutorials to understand how the technology works
* Once you have baseline familiarity with the new tech, branch out and make your own small learning project with the tech
* Integrate the technology into a larger project to see how it works with what you already know.

<details>
    <summary>I want to add something to my portfolio that is more meaningful/impactful than just a personal project I have created
</summary>
 
#### Get involved in FOSS (free and open source software) development! [more info](https://gasei.gitbook.io/sei/09-other-topics/post-sei/post-cohort-resources#getting-involved-in-open-source) below

Open source software is always looking for new contributes, and your contributions to projects can be put on your resume and portfolio.

How do you get started?

* Find a project you would like to contribute to
* Read their community and contributing guidelines
* Communicate with the maintainers and let them know you would like to help
* Setup the codebase, take your time to understand how it works, along with testing and the best practices of the codebase
* Read issues on github to find a bug or feature you would like to work on
* Often times you can communicate with maintainers in the issues' comments. You can ask them to point you in the right direction, or run your ideas on how to implement your changes by them

Getting started is usually the hardest part, but once you do it can be very worthwhile! Search for looking for help, welcoming to newcomers, and generally inclusive for the best initial experience.

## 📈 The Recipe for Success

* treat your studies and employment search like a 9 - 5 job: *punch in at 9 am and spend all day until 5 pm studying and job searching*
  * keeping so called 'banking hours (9am - 5pm)' is recommended because this is when potential employers are most active and will be communicating with you.
  * divide your time between job searching, practicing white boarding, learning and developing projects for your portfolio
* Maintain a community going post cohort -- stay active with your peers and maintain daily and weekly meetings to support each other and thrive together
    * Create and maintain a community space for your cohort to meet in (you can keep using slack and zoom or find alternatives)
    * Organize daily/weekly meetups
        * Hold regular group standups 
        * Meetup for white boarding practice
        * Have open study halls for peer programming and debug
        * Pair up with a pal and study a new tech together
        * collaborate on a project  
* Get involved in other development communities or open source projects
  * Open Source is a great way to get collaborative coding experience, get things to put in your portfolio and meet new friends and colleagues! 
  * Join GA Community slack channels
* Stay active on your github -- make your github appealing to potential employers
  * Pin the projects you are most proud of on your github and keep active by submitting pull requests and making new repos -- employers look at this and will mention it!
* Spend time focusing on knowledge areas you need to strengthen -- going over each unit and identifying the concepts you need more reps on is recommended.
* [*Eat the Frog* (swallow the frog)](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eat-the-frog) -- every part of the recipe is as important as the others, so if there is one part you are avoiding -- *do it first*. **Everyday.** **_Eat the Frog first thing._** 

### 🙌 Example Daily Study Plans

When planning out your daily studies post cohort, it is helpful to identify what your frog is and the area you would like to focus your studies. After a week or two of using the same daily study plan, you should spend some time reflecting and then update your focus and frog to write a new study plan. 

#### General Tips:

* Plan out daily sprints -- these can apply to non-coding activities too, such as _'I will have applied to two jobs by the end of my job search time today.'_
* Put your projects/most fun things towards the end of the day so you can look forward to working on them and also spend some free time in the evening continuing to work on them if you wish.
* When taking breaks, _take intentional breaks_. That is, really allow yourself to step away from your studies to rejuvenate when you break. 
    * Get away from screens and your workstation when taking a break
* Some people really thrive with the [pomodoro technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique), especially when doing mentally taxing activities such as whiteboarding practice and code challenges.
* Check your email first thing in the a.m. and set up email notifications so you can respond quickly to potential employers when they contact you.

## 📓 Class Resources

It is recommended that you take some time and review the materials from the cohort, focusing on any knowledge areas you need build up.

Revisiting fundamental topics will prove to be hugely beneficial because with your current coding skills, you will be able to dive deeper and solidify your foundational knowledge even more. _**The more your know, the more you grow!**_ 

* [GitBook](https://gawdiseattle.gitbook.io/wdi/) notes for all the topics we covered, and many more
* [The Seattle WDI-SEI Github Organization](https://github.com/WDI-SEA) Has all the repos the Seattle curriculum draws from
* your class recordings and calender
* The Slack channels will remain open for you to use for a while, but they will disappear eventually (a few months)
* The zoom recordings of class will exist for an indeterminate period of time, and can be downloaded if you with to save them. 
* Official GA materials such as your myGA dashboard and [the outcomes global experience](https://sites.google.com/generalassemb.ly/outcomesglobalexperience/home?authuser=0) dashboard (which is an awesome wealth of information, btw) will continue to exist for as long as they do.
