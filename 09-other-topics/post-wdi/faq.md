###I'm overwhelmed! What should I learn first?

Web development and software engineering are *extremely* broad topics. While it's impossible to know it all, it's possible to know the fundamentals, because they don't change as much.

What are web development fundamentals?

* Page layouts in HTML
* Styling a page with CSS
* Using JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements
* Creating an application server that communicates with a database

If you're overwhelmed, go back to the fundamentals. Having a solid foundation will help propel your career forward.

Also, if you're overwhelmed, it may just mean you need a break. Physical exercise is a great way to stay in shape in your new profession, as well as get the problem-solving juices flowing.

####Testimonials

> In my last job, I sometimes became overwhelmed with all the moving pieces of a feature I had to implement. I helped alleviate this feeling by forcing myself to take a walk every so often. I used a timer program to lock my screen every hour.

###Should I specialize in front-end or back-end development?

It depends on your background and what you want to do. If your background is heavy on graphic design or art, front-end will likely be your specialization. If your background is heavy on engineering or math, back-end may be a better specialization. It's also early on in your career, so if you're not sure, don't feel like you *have* to specialize. You can also work on both.

###I'm really worried that I'll encounter roadblocks when developing after WDI. What can I do to ease these worries?

People encounter roadblocks in the development process. It happens. However, we have equipped you with some of the resources needed to help overcome these roadblocks. In WDI, you used the following to overcome problems:

* Google
* MDN
* StackOverflow
* Documentation for...
  * Sequelize
  * Mongoose
  * Angular
  * jQuery
  * etc.

These tools will still exist for you. You also have more than just yourself. *You're not in this alone.* Think about who you could ask for help:

* Your instructors
* Your peers
* Your GA Seattle alumni network
* Your GA Global alumni network
* Software professionals on Github
  * Great for project-specific problems
* IRC
* Mentors
  * You can find mentors through friends, family, or meetups

Also remember that you want to maintain relationships with these people, so know *when to ask for help.* This is something we covered in WDI because it will help you for the rest of your life.

####Testimonials

> I can solve most of my problems by reading documentation, but it took me a while to understand the technical jargon. Sometimes you'll need to read the documentation several times and think critically about how the documentation is communicating to you.
> I also love to help others with problems because it makes my own understanding stronger. However, I do become drained and irritable when people take advantage of my willingness to help. It's something I keep in mind when I ask others for help. I try to do it only when I've exhausted all my immediate options, or if I'm on a time crunch.
