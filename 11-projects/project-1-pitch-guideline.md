# Project 1 Pitch Guideline

## Overview

Before you start your project, we want you to take time to think about _how_ you will actually build your game.

## Writing a Pitch

The first step in your planning, beyond coming up with your initial idea, is writting out a pitch to present to the instructional staff.

The intention is for you to 1. take the time to plan your project out, and 2. have us help you define what the bounds of your project should be.

**Write your pitch following the requirements below in the same `README.md` file in your empty P1 project folder.**

## Pitch Requirements

Your pitch must include:

* An elevator pitch of your game idea
* What tech stack you plan on using \(example: using Tailwind for styling\)
* Wireframes of your game
* MVP Goals
* Stretch Goals
* Any potential roadblocks

## Example Pitches

Below are some example P1 pitches from previous students:

* Dave Stach's [Garbage Boy Pitch](https://github.com/d4vves/garbage-boy/tree/3e81e21b420bd28c727a53faf881f7adc105176e)
* Weston Bailey's [Hyperdrive Pitch](https://github.com/weston-bailey/Hyperdrive/tree/c04ed7263b539df1ff38c87f5b02cd17744f0fab)
* Melissa Young's [Gradies Grueling Grind Pitch](https://github.com/melissay94/gradies-grueling-grind/tree/8bde73235007097ffa8e25a1d54c45d944405f40)

## What does MVP mean?

MVP stands for `minimum viable product`. It is a commonly used term in software development to refer to the base requirements of a finished product. Without this idea, the fear is that projects will never be released because we will always be adding features or improving things, even though a "perfect project" is not actually possible.

For your MVP goals, identify what features your game needs to have at minimum to be a functional, styled, and playable game.

A good MVP goal gives you a clear finish line to cross, but isn't so specific you can't be flexible when bugs/timeline changes come up.

Any additional features you want to build that are just fun, beyond your MVP requirements, would go into a separate `Stretch Goals` list.

## What Pitching Looks Like

You will each have x5-10 mins to pitch to the instructional team your idea.

During this pitch we will have you pull up your README and walk us through what your game is, what it will look like, what tech you plan to use, and what your MVP/stretch goals are.

Pitching to the instructional team is your opportunity to ask any questions you have about the project, but also gives us an opportunity to make sure you are scoping your project appropriately \(aka that your MVP goals are something you can actually reasonably accomplish within a week\).
