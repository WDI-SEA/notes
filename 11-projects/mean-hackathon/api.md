#MEAN Hackathon - Part 1

##Objectives

* Use prior concepts like RESTful endpoints, JWT tokens, and MongoDB to solve a problem
* Create a functioning API with a team

This is part 1 of a two-part, day-long hackathon. Winners will be rewarded hansomely at the discretion of the instructional staff.

##Theme

Your theme for this hackathon will be given to you by your instructors.

* Create a RESTful API that uses the following technologies:
  * Node.js
  * Express
  * MongoDB
  * Mongoose
* You must create at least two models (embedded documents count)
* JWT authentication is optional, but great if you want to protect your endpoints.
* You must deploy to Heroku sometime today. However, you can do so in the afternoon if you run out of time (Hint: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mongolab#adding-mongolab-as-a-heroku-add-on)
* You may work in groups of 2-4 people (use git)
* Test using Postman or another client
* Feel free to data scrape or find other ways to populate the database for your API.
* Note that there is a lot to do: teamwork is key
