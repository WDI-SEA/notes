_This document is for SEI1 Bahrain only._

## Option 1: Tic Tac Toe

If your Tic Tac Toe game was missing 3 or more of the following features, your project 1 will be to do a brand new Tic Tac Toe from scratch.

* X / O appears in square
* X / O Alternate
* Player turn shown	
* Winner is detected
* Can Win on Last Turn
* No alerts()
* Reset Button Works (and doesn't use `.reload()`)
* Can't click square twice
* Draw detected (only when a real tie)	
* Can't click square after winner found

This is an opportunity for you to really level up your end result. After you have a basic game that meets the requirements above, pick 2 or more bonus features from the following list:

* Persistent score keeping
* Option to play against the computer (start by having the computer make random moves, then if you'd like you can try implementing [MinMax](https://www.neverstopbuilding.com/blog/minimax) so the computer beats the user)
* Make the board 4x4, or add a "hard mode" options that uses a 4x4 board.
* Add a timer for each turn and sound effects and/or animations.

Feel free to get really creative with styling and make it as fancy as you want ***but don't work on styling until all of your functionality is complete!!!!***

## Option 2: Connect Four

---

## Option 3: Snowman

Like hangman, but instead of drawing a stick figure in the gallows, you gradually build a snowman! (Feel free to choose another variation of this game if you don't like the snowman option.)

---

## Option 4: Battleship

This will be user vs. computer, where the computer has randomly generated ship locations.

**Hint:** Start with single-cell ships. You can add different ship sizes later after the initial functionality is done.

---

## Option 5: War

(The card game.)

Persistent score-keeping is required. Consider adding other bonus features.
