### Overview

**The time has come for the final project.** Ideally, this project should incorporate some framework/technology we haven't covered, but feel free to use anything we have learned in the course as well.

Make sure you review your project proposal with your instructor so you can make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make sure it's **something that'll showcase your skills both visually and functionally**. Sometimes people do judge a book by its cover – or in this case, an app by its design.

### Groups or Solo?

You **may** work in a group. If you choose to do so, you will be responsible for forming your own groups. Max group size is **four devs**!

### Technical Requirements

Your app must (unless otherwise approved):

* **Use Django, Flask, or Express** to build an application backend 
    * Other frameworks and languages will be considered on a case-by-case basis
* **Create an application using at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user
    * Exception: If you are doing a Flask app, user auth is optional if you did not make an in-class boilerplate!
* Include **all major CRUD functions** for at least one of your models
    * At least one PUT
    * At least one DELETE
    * At least one POST
    * At least 2 GETs
* Create your own front-end! **Put effort into your design!**
    * If you have a friend in UX, feel free to consult with them or have them help you with non-code aspects of the project (such as wireframing, color palette, etc). After all, this is a portfolio piece - put your best work forward!
* Add authentication (log in) **AND authorization** (page protection) to restrict access to appropriate users
* **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard Git flow on Github
* Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**, with or without a framework.
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working app**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
    * An embedded screenshot of the app
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
    * Link to your **pitch deck** – documentation of your wireframes, user stories, and proposed architecture
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrated that you thought through alternative implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)_

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

| Score | Expectations |
| ----- | ------------ |
| **0** | _Incomplete._ |
| **1** | _Does not meet expectations._ |
| **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_ |
| **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_ |

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
