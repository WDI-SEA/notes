#Ruby on Rails

Rails is a framework that's used by startups and large companies across the globe. Examples of companies using Rails include Github, Airbnb, Kickstarter, and General Assembly. Twitter also used Rails in its early days.

As we learn Rails, we'll notice that it adheres to specific ideas. Specifically...

###Convention over Configuration

Using Node/Express involved a lot of **configuration.** We had to create folders, install packages, setup routes, setup a template engine, etc.

Rails involves more **conventions,** meaning that getting up and started is easier because **most of the decisions have been made for you.** When installing Rails, Rails initially decides on the template engine, ORM, and the organization of the project. While you can customize these decisions afterwards, following "the Rails way" via its conventions helps make your life easier.

Of course, the biggest hurdle is *learning* the conventions.

Rails is often referred to as [omakase](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2012/rails-is-omakase.html).
