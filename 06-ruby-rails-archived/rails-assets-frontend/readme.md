# Asset Pipeline and Front-end in Rails

## Objectives

* Incorporate JavaScript, CSS, SCSS, images, and other static files into a Rails application
* Describe the Asset Pipeline in laymans' terms
* Utilize helper methods/tags for including static resources
* Use `gon` to pass data to the front-end

We can work with JavaScript, CSS, and images in Rails just like we did in our front-end only projects. Rails uses the concept of an Asset Pipeline to handle pre-processing and loading of static assets. The "Rails way" is to put all of your assets (JavaScript, CSS/SASS, images) in the `assets` folder. Just do it!

## JavaScript

To load JavaScript files in Rails we simply create `.js` files in the `app/assets/javascripts` directory and Rails will automatically load them in the head of the page using `<script>` tags. 

To adjust the load order, we can add the scripts along with the `//=` lines at the bottom of `application.js`

#### application.js

application.js is used to load other JavaScript files and allows us to change the load order of the files. You *CAN* put JavaScript code directly in this file. But it's best practice to avoid this and use separate files as before.

At the bottom of `application.js` there are a few lines that look like comments and start with `//=` these are used to specify which files to load and in what order. The last line (`//= require_tree .`) loads all of the files in the `javascripts` directory that aren't loaded explicitly above.

For example, if we had a file called `importantScript.js` in our `javascripts` directory and we needed it to be loaded first we could simply do something like this...

```js
//= require 'importantScript.js'
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .
```

## Stylesheets

Rails uses SASS, which is a preprocessor for CSS that allows us to use some additional features that standard CSS doesn't support. These files end with the `.scss` file extension and are processed on the server (back-end) before they are sent to the user/browser as plain CSS.

Learn SASS here: [SASS](../additional-topics/sass/readme.md)

Just like with JavaScript, Rails will auto-load any CSS or SCSS file that are in `app/assets/stylesheets`.

Also, similar to JavaScript we can adjust the load order by editing the bottom of `application.css`, and again we should avoid putting CSS directly in this file.

## Images

We can load images by placing them in `app/assets/images` and using the rails `image_tag` helper to load them for us.

#### Images in views (erb)

If we have a file `app/assets/images/pic.jpg` we can display it in an erb file like this:

```html
<%= image_tag 'pic.jpg' %>
```

We can also get a string of the image URL/path by calling `image_url` or `image_path`.

#### Images in CSS (using SCSS)

We also have access to a `image_url` helper method in `scss` files. It will be used in place of the standard css `url('/path/to/image.jpg')` format.

```css
.some-class {
  background-image: image_url('pic.jpg');
}
```

**NOTE:** make sure the file is named `scss` and not just `css`. The `css` files are served to the browser as-is (no pre-processing), but `scss` are run through the sass pre-proccessor first which will run the `image_url` method and insert the correct image path.


## Passing data to the front-end (gon)

We can pass data from a controller to front-end JavaScript using a gem called "gon" which allows us to easily pass any data from the back-end to the front-end.

#### gon setup

To use gon (just like any other gem) we need to add it to our `GemFile`. After adding it remember to run `bundle install` and then restart your server with `rails s`

**in GemFile**

```ruby
gem 'gon'
```

Then we need to add a tag inside of our `<head>` tag that will load the backend values as javascript so we can use them in our frontend.

**in layouts/application.html.erb**

```html
<%= include_gon %>
```

Be sure to add this line BEFORE  `javascript_include_tag` that way the variables it defines will be available in your `.js` files.

#### Using gon

gon is very simple to use. It exposes a variable called `gon` the controller. `gon` is a hash that we can add any values to and they will be available on the front-end automatically.

**In controller**

```ruby
def index
  gon.something = "hello"
  gon.people = ['Lenny', 'Brian', 'Daniel']
  gon.tasks = Task.all
end
```

**In JS**

```javascript
console.log(gon.something);
//outputs: "hello"

console.log(gon.people);
//output: ['Lenny', 'Brian', 'Daniel']

console.log(gon.tasks);
//outputs: an array of objects for all tasks in the database
```

#### Pitfalls

There is only one major "gotcha" with `gon` and that is that `gon` won't be defined in JavaScript unless you assign something to it in the controller.

Assume we didn't assign any values to `gon` in the controller...

**in JS**

```javascript
console.log(gon.taco);
```

This would throw an error because `gon` is undefined. To avoid this problem we just need to check it using `typeof`.

```javascript
if (typeof gon !== 'undefined') {
  console.log('taco is', gon.taco);
} else {
  console.log('there is no gon (or taco)');
}
```

## AJAX in Rails

As an alternative to using `gon`, AJAX calls in Rails can be done if you have a controller action that returns JSON data. Here's an example. Let's assume this controller action can be accessed via the route `GET /names`.

```ruby
class NamesController < ApplicationController
  def names
    names = Name.all
    render json: names
  end
end
```

When accessing `GET /names`, the response will contain JSON data.

In order to access this route via AJAX, we can create a JavaScript file that accesses this route. We'll need to account for Turbolinks on the page by encapsulating the AJAX call inside an event called `ready page:load`.

```js
$(document).on('ready page:load', function() {
  $.get('/names').done(function(data) {
    console.log(data);
  });
});
```

This AJAX call can be triggered on form submission or button click by encapsulating the call within an event listener function. Example:

```js
$(document).on('ready page:load', function() {
  $('#button').click(function() {
    $.get('/names').done(function(data) {
      console.log(data);
    });
  });
});
```
