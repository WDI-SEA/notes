##Angular Intro

Angular is an open source JS framework maintained by Google. It was created nearly 6 years ago - its longevity is a testament to its capability and usefulness. AngularJS is one of the most widely adopted MVC JS frameworks in use today and is a valuable job skill to put on your resume.

AngularJS provides the following benefits when used to develop web apps:
* Enables us to organize and structure **single page apps** using the popular MVC design pattern
* Makes us more productive when developing web apps because it provides features, such as data binding, that requires less code from the developer
* Provides methods to inject dependencies, which make testing easier
